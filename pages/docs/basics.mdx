title: API Basics
---

üîç The Escrow API is structured around RESTful principles. It uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication via API keys, and JSON-encoded request and response bodies.

### Base URL

```
https://dev.api.usexcrow.com/v1/
```

### Authentication

All requests must include a valid API key in the header.

**Example:**

```http
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

The API provides endpoints to create wallets, handle funding and withdrawals, and manage multi-party escrow contracts.
It ensures secure payment flows by allowing users to initiate, fund, hold, and release transactions through the escrow vault.

## üì¶ Contract Types

### 1. Classic Contracts

**Use Case:** Peer-to-peer transactions, marketplace purchases, service agreements.

In a Classic Contract:

- Funds are held in escrow after both parties agree.
- The sender deposits the funds.
- The receiver delivers the agreed service/product.
- Upon confirmation, funds are released.
- Optional dispute resolution is available.

### 2. Wager Contracts

**Use Case:** Competitions, predictions, gamified applications.

In a Wager Contract:

- Two or more users stake an amount on a conditional outcome.
- A condition resolver (either automated or admin-defined) determines the winner.
- Funds are automatically distributed based on outcome.
- Useful in gaming, sports betting, or competitive freelance projects.
